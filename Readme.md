### **What did I learn from this Project?**

 - CSS Positions
 - Little bit of Flexbox
 - z-index
 - Pseudo class :hover

---

### **How much time did it take to build this project?**

- It took me about 2-3 hours to make this as the concept of Positions was not clear. 

---

I'm definitely more confident now to use CSS Positions in my future projects.
